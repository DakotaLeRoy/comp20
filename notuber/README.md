#Correctly Implemented
To the best of my knowledge, my program works properly according
to specifications.

#Time Spent
I have spent apprximately six hours on this assignment.

#Collaboration
I have received help from several Comp20 TAs and from classmate
Tati Doyle.

Please note, much of the code I have used is from the
comp20 github examples folder. Additionally, I had to fix a git
issue that removed my previous commits.
